## Project Overview

This project bridges the gap between massive backend transaction data and strategic decision-making.  
I built a high-performance, fully dynamic Excel dashboard that delivers instant visibility into key e-commerce metrics across three major platforms in the MENA market.

**Key Business Impact**  
- Tracks **Month-to-Date (MTD)** and **Month-over-Month (MoM)** sales growth  
- Calculates accurate **regional market share** and **city-level revenue** breakdowns  
- Monitors **average price point** (~$10K in high-value segments)  
- Incorporates **customer sentiment** metrics from reviews/ratings  
- Handles multi-currency, multi-platform data with 100% attribution accuracy

All achieved using **SQL** for heavy lifting and **Excel** (Power Query + PivotTables + dynamic arrays) for visualization — no BI tools required.
